nodemon app.js --ext js,hbs        //running the nodemon for multiple extension files


------------QUERY STRING in URL ----------------------

http://weather?search=games&place=delhi

These are only Key value pair


res.query = {'search'='games','place':'delhi'}


------------PARAMETERS IN URL ------------------------

http://weather/:id       //in code

http://weather/2342       //in browser


res.params = {'id':2342}



for multiple res.send() we use generally the return keyword to avoid the error in back-end



for checking the ssk key 
        ls -a -l ~/.ssh

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "pawnbisht83@gmail.com"        


# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
> Agent pid 59566


$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard


---------------------------HEROKU CLI------------------------

heroku keys:add
heroku create pawan-demo-express

We have to also specify the starting point where the application is starting.
To do that we have to specify it in the script tag in package.json
        So heroku runs a command 
npm run start          //That tell that run the start script cmd specified in packge.json 


----------------------------FOR DEVELOPEMNT---------------------------

in package.json 
script tag have a property called
"dev":"nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs


npm run dev

we have to generally use the local dev dependencies instead of global dependencies
i,e we have to install the nodemon as the local dependency.
 by Using 
 npm i  nodemon --save -dev
        devDependencies :{nodemon:"2.0.2"}
        In this devDependencies only dependencies that you only need for local machine.
        Well thase dependencies aren't install in production environment


we need to also pass the basic information to our app

--------------------------DEPLOYEMENT------------------------

any changes that occur in main project should be reflected to our deployed application
So we need to do several steps;
        git remote                              //to check the remaote server
1, firstly to push our code to github 
2, git push heroku master
3,
